# linkedparts
this is a cool module that allows you to create parts with "connected" properties.

i.e: transparency

i have a group of parts that i use as hitboxes and want to make them visible/invisible on command
all i gotta do is create a group, and link the hitboxes from there!
then if i wanna change the transparency, the changes will be applied to all the parts.
